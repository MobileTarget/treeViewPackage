## What a node is ?
---
Nodes get created when a flow is deployed, they may send and receive some messages whilst the flow is running and they get deleted when the next flow is deployed.

They consist of a pair of files; a JavaScript file that defines what the node does, and an html file that defines the nodeâ€™s properties, edit dialog and help text.

When packaged as an npm module, a package.json file is used to pull it all together.

###### Installation in local node-red
Go to project root directory and run the following command.

        sudo npm link   
> (if node is not install as root user the no need to use sudo before command.)
  
 Go to home directory and move to ".node-red" installtion directory and run the again same command above i.e.

        sudo npm link 
> (if node is not install as root user no need to use sudo before command.)
 
 The above both 2 command will create a "symbolic link" between your node-red dashboard code and the actual node project which you were deveolping for node-red.
 Each time when you make any new changes in you node project code, you just need to restart you node-red server and will get the updated output in node-red dashboard.
    
###### Installation on live node-red
To use the node globally in any of you live project you need to publish it on npm globally after that can easily install it inside the node-red via using the following command i.e.

        npm install "node_name" --save

To publish code on npm globally you need to following the following link:-
